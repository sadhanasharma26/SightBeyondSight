# Sight Beyond Sight - A Lablab.ai Hackathon Project

üèÜ OpenAI Stack Hack Participant üöÄ

We participated in the OpenAI Stack Hack, a global AI Hackathon organised by Lablab.ai, a thrilling week-long event (24th February to 3rd March) dedicated to exploring the potential of generative AI. Our project focused on enhancing online content accessibility for the visually impaired using advanced AI tools. By leveraging GPT-3, Codex, Dalle-2, and Whisper, we developed a cost-effective text-to-speech service that provides natural human-toned summaries of web content and describes images using labels generated by Google Cloud Vision API. Redis caching and voice control capabilities further optimize the user experience. Out of the 7322 participants our team was voted the most favorite project!
